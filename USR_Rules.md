# Terms of Conduct for Users (1.0)
### Nothing Phone (2a) & (2a) Plus

These terms apply to all members of the Nothing Phone (2a)/(2a) Plus aftermarket community. \
By participating, you agree to maintain respect, responsibility, and integrity across all spaces.

------

## [1] — Respect
Every developer part of this community volunteers their time and expertise to provide support for a product that won't be permanently supported by the company you brought it from. For this reason, we don't owe anybody anything.

- Remember to be kind and appreciative.
- You may **request**, but never **demand** features, fixes, or ETAs.
- Offer constructive feedback, not complaints.

------

## [2] — Communication
Keep discussions civil and productive. Educate yourself on existing publicly available documentation whenever possible and help your fellow community members whenever you can.

You, as a member, are allowed to self-police and push away unsavory individuals that poison discourse. All of this within reason, of course.

- Use clear language and avoid hostility.
- Keep unnecessary profanity low, and avoid low-blow insults, or unsubstanciated personal attacks.

- Doxxing or sharing private information without permission about any developer or community member — including real names, locations, or personal accounts is strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate, permanent ban.

------

## [3] — Support
Before asking for help, **read existing guides, FAQs, and pinned messages**. All we ask for is for you to respect people's time. We have a whole knowledge base in the works that we hope will one day be detailed enough for a new user to avoid participating on Telegram in the first place.
 
- Provide relevant info when requesting help (logs, ROM version, etc.).
- Avoid repetitive/spammy requests.

------


## [4] — Contribution & Community Support

You really don’t have to be a developer to contribute, everyone can help in some way. \ 
This community only exists because of the time, knowledge, and generosity of many individuals.

- **Share knowledge:** If you’ve learned something, pass it on. Answer questions, write guides, or help new users find what they're looking for.
- **Support your favorite developers:** If you appreciate their work, consider donating or otherwise supporting them. Monetary support can do wonders for morale and drive, it helps keep devices alive long after official support ends.
- **Take responsibility:** Encourage helpful discussion, de-escalate conflicts, and work to make the space better than how you found it.

------

## [5] — Sharing content
Share responsibly. Know what you're forwarding before you press the button.

- Refrain from sharing untested or low-quality builds publicly.
- Always credit original sources.
- No pornography, political, or unrelated content that doesn't belong in the group.

> If you are found to be sharing software that's malicious, has artificially made backdoors or has been tampered with, you will be immediately banned from all community spaces with no warning. This is considered an offense of the highest degree in our circle.

------

## [6] — Discipline
Breaking any of these rules may result in warnings or permanent bans from all community spaces.
Severity depends on the nature of the violation.
